# Gaussian-Elimination-
This program uses the Naive Gaussian Elimination algorithm to solve a system of linear equations. I decided to test my python programming skill by writing this program as i learnt the topic in Numerical Methods, a course I took as a computer engineering student in junior year.

The steps in the algorithm include:
1. Forward elimination to get an equation with one variable.
2. Backward substitution in steps to find values of the other unknown variables
